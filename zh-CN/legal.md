# 商标政策

The Rust and Cargo names and brands make it possible to say what is officially
part of the Rust community, and what isn't. So we're careful about where we
allow them to appear. But at the same time, we want to allow for as much
creative use of these brands as we can. The policy laid out here explains how we
strike a balance. If you want to use these names or brands, especially in a
commercial way, please read this page or feel free to
[reach out](mailto:trademark@rust-lang.org) and ask us about it!

**TL;DR**: Most non-commercial uses of the Rust/Cargo names and logos are
allowed and do not require permission; most commercial uses require
permission. In either case, the most important rule is that uses of the
trademarks cannot appear official or imply any endorsement by the Rust project.

## Rust 商标

The Rust programming language is an open source, community project governed by a
core team. It is also sponsored by the Mozilla Foundation ("Mozilla"), which
owns and protects the Rust and Cargo trademarks and logos (the "Rust
Trademarks"). This document provides information about use of the Rust
Trademarks specific to a programming language, as well as examples of common
ways people might want to use these trademarks, with explanations as to whether
those uses are OK or not or require permission. This document supplements the
[official Mozilla trademark policy](https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/)
which governs use of all Mozilla trademarks.

The Rust Trademarks include two word marks and two logos:

* Rust
* Cargo
* <img src="https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-blk.svg">
* <img src="https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/cargo.png">

Trademarks are names and designs that tell the world the source of a good or
service. Protecting trademarks for an open source project is particularly
important. Anyone can change the source code and produce a product from that
code, so it's important that only the original product, or variations that have
been approved by the project, use the project's trademarks. By limiting use of
the Rust Trademarks, Mozilla and the Rust project can help users and developers
know they're getting the product produced by the Rust project and not someone
else's modified version. The trademark assures users and developers of the
quality and safety of the product they're using.

## 使用商标

### Appearing official, affiliated, or endorsed

The most basic rule is that the Rust trademarks cannot be used in ways that
appear (to a casual observer) official, affiliated, or endorsed by the Rust
project or Mozilla, unless you have written permission from the Rust core team.
This is the fundamental way we protect users and developers from confusion.

Since this rule is about managing perception, it is subjective and somewhat
difficult to nail down concretely. There are some obvious ways to avoid
problems, like including the word "unofficial" in a very prominent way, but if
you have any doubts, we would be more than happy to help; just send mail to
[trademark@rust-lang.org](mailto:trademark@rust-lang.org).

### The basics: referring to Rust/Cargo

As with any trademark, the Rust and Cargo word marks can be used with minimal
restriction to refer to the Rust programming language and the Cargo package
manager and registry.

They may not be used:

- to refer to any other programming language;
- in a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated modules,
  tools, documentation, or other resources with the Rust programming language;
- in ways that confuse the community as to whether the Rust programming language
  is open source and free to use.

### 不需要明确批准的用途

There are a variety of uses that do not require explicit approval. **However, in all of the cases outlined below, you must ensure that use of the Rust trademarks does not appear official, as explained above.**

* Stating accurately that software is written in the Rust programming language,
that it is compatible with the Rust programming language, or that it contains
the Rust programming language, is allowed. In those cases, you may use
the Rust trademarks to indicate this, without prior approval. This is true both
for non-commercial and commercial uses.

* Using the Rust trademarks in the names of non-commercial products like
RustPostgres or Rustymine, or in the name of code repositories in e.g. GitHub,
is allowed when referring to use with or suitability for the Rust
programming language. Such uses may also include the Rust logo, even in modified
form. For commercial products (including crowdfunded or sponsored ones), please
check in at [trademark@rust-lang.org](mailto:trademark@rust-lang.org) to ensure your
use does not appear official.

* Using the Rust trademarks on t-shirts, hats, and other artwork or merchandise,
even in modified form, is allowed for your personal use or for use by a
small group of community members, as long as they are not sold. If you want to
distribute merchandise with Rust Trademarks at a Rust affiliated event, please
contact us for permission at [trademark@rust-lang.org](mailto:trademark@rust-lang.org).

* Using the Rust trademarks (even in modified form) for social events like
meetups, tutorials, and the like is allowed for events that are free to attend. For commercial events (including sponsored ones), please check in at [trademark@rust-lang.org](mailto:trademark@rust-lang.org). However, the words "RustCamp", "RustCon" or
"RustConf" cannot be used without explicit permission. And, as with all of the
above uses, the **event cannot appear to be officially endorsed or run by the Rust project** without written permission.

* Using the Rust trademarks in books or publications like "Rust Journal" or
"Rust Cookbook" is allowed.

* Using of the word "Rust" on websites, brochures, documentation, academic
papers, books, and product packaging to refer to the Rust programming language
or the Rust project is allowed.

### 需要明确批准的用途

* Distributing a modified version of the Rust programming language or the Cargo
package manager and calling it Rust or Cargo requires explicit, written
permission from the Rust core team. We will usually allow these uses as long as
the modifications are (1) relatively small and (2) very clearly communicated to
end-users.

* Selling t-shirts, hats, and other artwork or merchandise requires explicit,
written permission from the Rust core team. We will usually allow these uses as
long as (1) it is clearly communicated that the merchandise is not in any way an
official part of the Rust project and (2) it is clearly communicated whether
profits benefit the Rust project.

* 除上述事例外，在其他商标中使用 Rust 商标需要 Rust 核心团队的书面许可。
